                        <h3>Our History</h3>
                        Heavenmakers was born out of a simple yet profound question: <b><i>What if we could create personal utopias for everyone?</i></b> 
                        <p>
                            Founded in 2035 by renowned futurist <b>Dr. Elara Nyx</b>, psychologist <b>Dr. Jonathan Hale</b>, and acclaimed architect <b>Sophia Li</b>, the company started as an ambitious research project 
                            exploring the intersection of human fulfillment, cutting-edge technology, and sustainable design. From their early experiments in immersive virtual environments to developing 
                            fully customized habitats, the trio’s dream was <i>to help people live the life they've always desired</i>.
                            <br>
                            What began as a small, innovative startup has since grown into a global movement. From Earth-based retreats to revolutionary space habitats, Heavenmakers has designed 
                            <i>over 10,000 personalized utopias</i>, each one as unique as its inhabitant. We take pride in the trust we’ve built with our clients, who continue to push the boundaries of what life can look like.
